* Documentation
*** WIP Copy available docs from screamer.ps to docstrings.
*** TODO Find / write docs for then still undocumented exported functions.
*** WIP A web-friendly manual
* Performance
*** TODO Rewrite dynamic-extent continuations using FLET
    At least SBCL cannot currently stack-allocate a let-bound lambda,
    but manages FLET and LABELS just fine.
*** TODO Dynamic-extent in CPS-CONVERT-TAGBODY.
* Maintenance
*** TODO TEST-OP for the system.
* Old "Bugs to fix" list from screamer.lisp
  These haven't been verified or anything, just moved here.
*** TODO LOCAL SETF does the wrong thing with GETHASH.
*** TODO LOCAL (SETF/SETQ X e) will signal an error if X is unbound
    because it needs to trail the previous value of X and it has none.
*** TODO Deterministic/nondeterministic LOCAL SETF/SETQ undone out of order.
*** TODO Changing determinism status
    can cause code from a different file to be included causing wierd behavior.
*** TODO Will signal an obscure error if FAIL is called in a deterministic
    context which is not nested in a choice point.

*** TODO May loop when expressions contain circular lists.
*** TODO APPLY-NONDETERMINISTIC conses.
* Future Work
*** TODO See if it would make sense to make nondeterministic functions funcallable instances.
