* WIP Documentation
*** WIP Copy available docs from screamer.ps to docstrings.
*** TODO Find / write docs for then still undocumented exported functions.
*** WIP A web-friendly manual
* TODO Rewrite dynamic-extent continuations using FLET
  At least SBCL cannot currently stack-allocate a let-bound lambda,
  but manages FLET and LABELS just fine.
* TODO Dynamic-extent in CPS-CONVERT-TAGBODY.
* TODO TEST-OP for the system.
* TODO See if it would make sense to make nondeterministic functions funcallable instances.
